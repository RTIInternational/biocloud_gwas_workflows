# WDL workflow eigenstrat_smartpca: Principle components analysis 

This repository contains a WDL workflow named eigenstrat_smartpca. This workflow performs Eigenstrat PCA analysis on Plink formatted genotype data (bed,bim,fam). It uses a user-provided [UCSC Genome Browser's BED formatted](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1) file to locate regions of high LD and subsequently remove SNP from the Plink files that are within those genomic loci. The workflow then runs smartpca â€“ a program implemented within the software package eigenstrat that performs PCA on genetic data to identify population structure and correct for population stratification in association studies. It calculates principal components and eigenvalues from the genetic data matrix. The final result is a file that contains the principal component scores for each individual (samples) in your dataset along the corresponding eigenvectors. Each row represents one individual, and the columns contain the scores for each principal component.

**_Notes_**
* The header of the final results file includes the eigenvalues (eigvals).
* We do not include case/control information, thus the last column will contain `???`. Otherwise it would have indicated case or control.
* SampleIDs were renamed to avoid program crashes caused by length issues, but their order matches the provided Plink genotype data.

## EIGENSOFT
[EIGENSOFT](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/alkes-price/software/) is a widely used software package for population genetics and principal component analysis (PCA). It was developed by the Population Genetics Working Group at the Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School. Eigensoft provides various tools for analyzing genetic data, particularly single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data obtained from genotyping arrays or sequencing studies. 

Eigensoft's primary functionality is conducting PCA on large-scale genetic data. PCA is used to visualize and identify population structure and genetic relatedness patterns within a dataset. It helps researchers understand the genetic diversity and relationships among individuals or populations. **Eigenstrat** is a part of the Eigensoft software package that employs PCA (in particular smartpca). 

### Detecting Population Stratification
Eigenstrat employs principal component analysis (PCA) on genetic data to identify and correct for population stratification. Here's how it typically works:
<details>
  <summary>expand for explanation</summary>

1. **Genetic Data Input**: Eigenstrat takes genetic data, usually in the form of SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) data, as input. This data contains genotypes of individuals at various genetic markers across the genome.
1. **PCA Calculation**: Eigenstrat performs principal component analysis (PCA) on the genetic data. PCA helps identify the principal components that explain the largest sources of genetic variation within the dataset. In the context of population stratification, these principal components often correspond to the underlying genetic ancestry of the individuals.
1. **Population Structure Inference**: The principal components identified by PCA can be used to infer the genetic ancestry of each individual in the dataset. This information allows Eigenstrat to group individuals with similar genetic backgrounds together.
1. **Statistical Correction**: After inferring the population structure, Eigenstrat statistically corrects for the confounding effects of population stratification in association tests. It adjusts the association statistics to account for the genetic ancestry of the individuals, thereby reducing the risk of false-positive associations.
   
By applying Eigenstrat's population stratification correction, researchers can improve the accuracy and reliability of genetic association studies, making it a valuable tool in genetic epidemiology and related research areas.

## regions of high LD
Provide [BED-formatted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BED_(file_format)) files. BED starts are zero-based and BED ends are one-based ([ref](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/bedtools/BEDTools-User-Manual.v4.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A381%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C54%2C392.724%2C0%5D)). The workflow handles this with
```
if region[1] < pos <= region[2]:
```
<details>
  <summary>example BED files</summary>

There are example BED files on S3 for genome build 37 and 38. These files were created using the wiki at: https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Regions_of_high_linkage_disequilibrium_(LD).
You can use these, or create your own to provide to the workflow.
